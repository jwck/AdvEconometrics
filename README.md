# AdvEconometrics
Quick demonstration of two-stage least squares being used to help with the problem of endogeneity using a simple simulation

Also shows how it can make the problem worse (if one attempts to use "weak instruments")

This was done as part of the advanced econometrics course, where we were asked to choose and demonstrate one of the methods discussed in class
